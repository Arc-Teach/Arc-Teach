  Hi, I’m @Arc-Teach
  
  I teach Computer Science and Robotics Education, I teach them in a 7-12 Public Middle/High School.
  
  Game design is my favorite tool for learning and teaching programming! I'm learning Godot and Unity.
  
  Opportunities to collaborate on Computer Science or Robotics fields are welcome, whether your from education or another industry!
